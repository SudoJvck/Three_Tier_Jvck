To verify the functionality of your three-tier network design in Cisco's Packet Tracer, you can use various show commands on different devices. Below is a list of show commands you can use along with brief descriptions:

### General Network Information:
1. **`show ip interface brief`**:
   - Description: Displays a brief summary of the IP addresses assigned to all interfaces.

2. **`show vlan brief`**:
   - Description: Provides a summary of VLAN information, including VLAN IDs, names, and status.

### Core Layer (Multilayer Switches):
3. **`show ip route`**:
   - Description: Displays the routing table, showing the known routes and next-hop information.

4. **`show interfaces trunk`**:
   - Description: Lists all trunk interfaces along with their VLAN information.

### Distribution Layer (Multilayer Switches):
5. **`show ip ospf neighbor`**:
   - Description: Shows OSPF neighbor information, verifying OSPF adjacency.

6. **`show vlan brief`**:
   - Description: Verifies VLAN configurations on distribution layer switches.

### Access Layer (Access Switches):
7. **`show vlan brief`**:
   - Description: Confirms VLAN configurations on access layer switches.

8. **`show interfaces status`**:
   - Description: Displays the status of all interfaces, indicating which are up or down.

### Router Configuration:
9. **`show ip nat translations`**:
   - Description: Displays the active NAT translations, confirming PAT functionality.

10. **`show ip dhcp binding`**:
    - Description: Shows active DHCP bindings, confirming DHCP assignments.

### Wireless Configuration:
11. **`show dot11 associations`**:
    - Description: Displays information about associated wireless clients.

### OSPF Configuration:

    - Description: Provides information about OSPF interfaces and their states.

### DHCP Server:
13. **`show ip dhcp pool`**:
    - Description: Displays DHCP pool information, confirming configured pools.

### Default Routes:
14. **`show ip route`**:
    - Description: Verifies the presence of default routes on layer 3 devices.

15. **`show access-lists`**:
    - Description: Displays information about configured access lists.

### Testing Connectivity:
16. Use **`ping`** commands:
    - Description: Verify end-to-end connectivity by pinging devices across different VLANs.

17. **`traceroute`**:
    - Description: Traces the route to a destination, confirming proper routing.

These show commands can help you verify the configuration and functionality of your three-tier network design in Cisco's Packet Tracer. Adjust the commands as needed based on the specifics of your environment.
