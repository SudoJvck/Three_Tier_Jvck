### Project Overview

At the core of all networking technologies lies network design. Various architectures offer unique advantages to organizations at different levels. In this session, we'll be crafting and setting up a Three-Tiered Campus Network using Cisco's Packet Tracer, covering the entire process.

While it's worth noting that Packet Tracer has some limitations in terms of real-world functionality, its capabilities are sufficient for meeting our objectives today.

### Step 1: Business Requirements

Every business has unique networking needs tailored to its operations. In our scenario today, we're working with a Flooring Supply company about to open a new office with 600 employees, and we'll focus on meeting the following objectives:

- Redundancy: Achieved through dual routers, multi-layer switches, and simulated dual ISP connections for robust failover capabilities.
  
- Scalability: Utilizing a three-tiered design enables the company to expand its network infrastructure seamlessly with growing user numbers, devices, and transaction volumes.

- Reliability: The core layer establishes a highly reliable backbone, ensuring continuous operation and minimizing downtime.

- Security: The distribution layer enforces security policies, while the access layer ensures secure connectivity for end-user devices, safeguarding sensitive customer information and transaction data.

### Step 2: Bandwidth Calculation

Accurately calculating the required bandwidth for a network is essential to meet the organization's needs. Considerations include traffic patterns, user requirements, and application needs. The tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to calculating and managing bandwidth requirements.

### Step 3: Network Segmentation

In this step, we determine the appropriate address space for our network. We've chosen the IPV4 address 17.16.0.0/22, providing approximately 1024 addresses, more than sufficient for our current needs. Subnets and configurations for each department are detailed in the tutorial.

### Step 4: Design

The architectural framework involves a three-tiered system designed for scalability, reliability, redundancy, and security. The core, distribution, and access layers are explained to address our business requirements.

### Step 5: Configuration

Detailed instructions are provided for configuring devices using Cisco's Packet Tracer. This includes device connections, basic configurations, SSH setup, VLAN configurations, Multilayer Switch VLAN Configuration, IP Addressing, OSPF, DHCP, Wireless Configurations, and Port Address Translations (PAT).

### GitHub Repository Contents:

1. **Commands.txt**: These files contain all of the necessary commands for each device. You can copy and paste these commands into the command-line interface of your Cisco devices. Be cautious and adapt the commands to your specific environment.
2. **README.md**: This document, providing an overview of the project, steps, and configurations. Refer to this README for a comprehensive understanding of the project.
3. **Packet_Tracer_File.pkt**: The Packet Tracer file with the pre-configured network. You can open this file in Packet Tracer to explore the configured network, make changes, and test different scenarios.

### Conclusion

The project concludes with testing configurations to ensure that all protocols and configurations are functioning correctly. Feel free to explore additional provisions and optimizations beyond the basics.

We hope you find this project helpful and insightful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy networking!
